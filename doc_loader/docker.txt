--- DOCKER OVERVIEW ---

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and 
management of applications using containerization.

Key Concepts:
1. Containers: Lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include 
   everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, system tools, libraries).
2. Images: Read-only templates used to create containers.
3. Dockerfile: A text document containing all the commands a user could call 
   on the command line to assemble an image.
4. Docker Hub: A cloud-based repository where users can link, store, and 
   share their Docker images.

Why Use Docker?
- Consistency: Works the same on your laptop as it does in production.
- Efficiency: Containers share the host system's kernel, making them much 
  faster and smaller than Virtual Machines (VMs).
- Isolation: Applications run in their own environments, preventing conflicts.
